            <h2>6. Fees and Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>6.1 Employer Fees.</strong> Fees for staffing services are
              charged to Employers and are set forth in individual service
              agreements. Fee structures may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Direct Hire Placement Fees:</strong> Calculated as a
                percentage of the placed candidate&apos;s first-year annual
                compensation
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Contract Staffing Rates:</strong> Hourly bill rates that
                include the contractor&apos;s pay rate plus a markup for our
                services, employer taxes, insurance, and administration
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retained Search Fees:</strong> Engagement fees and
                completion fees for executive search assignments
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>RPO Fees:</strong> Monthly management fees and/or
                per-hire fees as specified in the RPO agreement
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>6.2 Payment Terms.</strong> Unless otherwise specified in
              the applicable service agreement: (a) invoices for direct hire
              placements are due upon candidate start date; (b) contract
              staffing invoices are issued weekly or bi-weekly and are due net
              thirty (30) days; (c) late payments may be subject to interest at
              the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the
              maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>6.3 Placement Guarantee.</strong> Direct hire placements
              are subject to our standard guarantee period as specified in the
              service agreement (typically ninety (90) days). If a placed
              candidate voluntarily resigns or is terminated for cause during
              the guarantee period, we will provide a replacement candidate at
              no additional fee or issue a prorated refund, at our discretion,
              subject to the terms and conditions of the service agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>6.4 Conversion Fees.</strong> If an Employer wishes to
              convert a contract employee to a permanent, direct-hire position,
              a conversion fee will apply as specified in the service agreement.
              The conversion fee is typically calculated based on the number of
              hours worked and the remaining contract term.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>6.5 Taxes.</strong> All fees are exclusive of taxes. You
              are responsible for paying all applicable sales, use, value-added,
              and other taxes, except for taxes based on our net income.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>6.6 Disputes.</strong> Any fee disputes must be submitted
              in writing within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Failure to
              dispute an invoice within this period constitutes acceptance of
              the charges.

              but is not limited to, business plans, financial information,
              customer lists, pricing information, trade secrets, proprietary

              through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known to the
              receiving party prior to disclosure; (c) is independently

              formal dispute resolution proceeding, you agree to first contact
              us at contact@humanlystaffing.com to attempt to resolve the
              dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve the dispute
              informally by contacting you via email. If the dispute is not
              resolved within thirty (30) days of submission, either party may
              proceed with the formal dispute resolution procedures below.

              <strong>16.2 Binding Arbitration.</strong> If informal resolution

              with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (or

              conducted by a single arbitrator with expertise in commercial or
              employment matters. The arbitration shall be conducted in English
              and shall take place in Cheyenne, Wyoming, or at another location
              mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator&apos;s
              decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as a
              judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>16.4 Costs.</strong> Each party shall bear its own costs

              court if the claim qualifies; (b) either party may seek injunctive
              or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
              prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation,
              or violation of intellectual property rights or confidential
              information; and (c) claims for unpaid fees may be pursued in
              court or through arbitration at the Company&apos;s election.

              <strong>16.6 Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration

              any failure or delay in performing our obligations under these

              natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes,
              cyber-attacks, government actions, labor disputes, utility

              <strong>20.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> These Terms do
              not confer any rights, remedies, or benefits upon any person or

              successors and permitted assigns.
