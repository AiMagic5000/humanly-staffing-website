            <h3>11.2 Criteria for Retention</h3>

              When personal information is no longer required, we will securely
              delete or anonymize it. Deletion may not be immediate due to
              technical requirements, backup systems, or legal holds. We will
              make reasonable efforts to delete your information from all
              systems within a reasonable timeframe.
